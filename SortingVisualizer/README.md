# Bubble Sort Visualizer

This project provides a simple visual representation of the Bubble Sort algorithm using ASCII art in the terminal.

## How It Works

The program sorts an array of integers using the Bubble Sort algorithm and prints each step of the sorting process to the terminal. The current state of the array is visualized with ASCII characters, making it easy to see how the algorithm works.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the script.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/SortingVisualizer.git
    cd SortingVisualizer
    ```

2. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your machine.

### Running the Visualizer

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

    ```bash
    cd SortingVisualizer
    ```

2. Run the script.

    ```bash
    python bubble_sort_visualizer.py
    ```

3. You should see the initial array printed in the terminal, followed by each step of the sorting process.

## Customization

- **Change the Speed**: You can adjust the speed of the visualization by changing the value of `time.sleep(0.1)` in the `bubble_sort` function. A lower value will speed up the visualization, while a higher value will slow it down.
- **Test with Different Arrays**: Modify the `array` variable in the `main` block to visualize sorting different sets of data.

## Example

Here's an example of what the output might look like:
