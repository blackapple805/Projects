Command to sign the file:
Not shown in the screenshot, but typically:

sh
Copy code
openssl pkeyutl -sign -in bottle.sha -inkey priv.key -out bottle.sig
Command to verify the file:

sh
Copy code
openssl pkeyutl -verify -in bottle.sha -sigfile bottle.sig -pubin -inkey pub.key
Purpose of "encrypting" with the private key:
It's not encryption; it's signing. The signature verifies the sender's identity and the message's integrity.

Steps to verify bottle and bottle.sig:

Generate a hash of bottle.
Use the public key to verify the hash against bottle.sig.
Success indicates no changes; failure indicates tampering or wrong public key
