Private Key Variables: {p, q, n, e, d}

In OpenSSL, p and q are the prime factors of n.
n is the modulus.
e is the public exponent.
d is the private exponent.
Public Key Variables: {n, e}

In OpenSSL, the public key contains the modulus n and the public exponent e.
Expectation in Public Key:

Based on the above, we should expect to see the modulus n and the public exponent e in the public key file.
Command to Confirm Public Key Contents:

The command to display the public key information is:
sh
Copy code
openssl rsa -pubin -in pub.key -text -noout
This command will confirm that the public key contains the modulus n and the public exponent e, as seen in the provided output.
Reason to Give Away n in Public Key:

We can give away n in our public key because it is the product of two large primes p and q. 
The security of RSA relies on the fact that while it is easy to multiply p and q together to get n, it is currently not feasible to do the reverse (factoring n back into p and q) within a practical amount of time. 
This one-way function property is what makes RSA secure for public distribution.
